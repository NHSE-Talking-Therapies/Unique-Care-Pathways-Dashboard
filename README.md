# NHS Talking Therapies for Anxiety and Depression
## Unique Care Pathways Dashboard

- A unique care pathway only includes one type of appointment throughout the whole course of treatment, however it can be combined with employment support. This includes the first appointment which could be Assessment and Treatment. Further analysis will be carried out to look at care pathways excluding those who have Assessment and Treatment as their first appointment.
